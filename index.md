# Hi, I'm Abdullah Alhusaini.

I build simple, effective software.

I'm a developer in Riyadh, passionate about creating user-friendly tools. I believe in clean interfaces and powerful functionality. I've worked with diverse technologies, from Python and Go for AI projects to Elixir for web development, and I'm always eager to learn more.

## My Approach

* **Simplicity:** I prioritize clear, intuitive design.
* **Practicality:** I build tools that solve real problems.
* **Learning:** I'm always exploring new technologies and ideas.

## Things I've Done

### DevAgent:

* **Summary:** An AI that learns instantly. We won first place at the MENA region's largest AI hackathon. DevAgent quickly processes and understands data, providing accurate responses without extensive training.
* **Technical:** Python, Go, JavaScript. Proprietary machine learning techniques for rapid data ingestion and analysis.
* **Call to Action:** [Contact me](/contact) for a custom demo.

### [DaarbNotes:](https://github.com/a-alhusaini/daarbnotes)

* **Summary:** DaarbNotes was born from a desire for privacy and accessibility. As someone who relies heavily on note-taking for everything from lectures to daily planning, I became concerned about the privacy of my data. Frustrated with accessibility limitations in existing note-taking apps, I created DaarbNotes: an offline, screen reader-friendly note-taking application designed for personal use. It ensures your notes remain yours, stored locally and secure from unwanted access.
* **Technical:** Built using Wails, a Go-based desktop application framework, DaarbNotes leverages the power of Go for backend efficiency and vanilla JavaScript for a clean, lightweight frontend. This approach allowed for a seamless development experience, combining the strengths of both technologies to create a responsive and accessible application.

### [نشرة بالوتي (Nashrah Balooti](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA/id6738954581)

* **Summary:** While many scorekeeping apps exist for Baloot, a popular card game in the Gulf region, they often present accessibility challenges and, more frustratingly, an onslaught of intrusive advertisements. Imagine an ad popping up with every single button press – that was the norm. As a blind Baloot enthusiast, I found traditional paper scorekeeping cumbersome and existing apps unbearable. نشرة بالوتي addresses these issues by providing a free, accessible, and mercifully ad-free scorekeeping solution, ensuring everyone can enjoy the game without these infuriating barriers.
* **Technical:** Built using CapacitorJS, نشرة بالوتي leverages web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) within a native iOS environment through WKWebView. This approach allows for familiar development while ensuring excellent accessibility and a smooth user experience.

### Legal Search Engine (KSA)](http://case-law.fly.dev):

* **Summary:** As a law student at King Saud University, I frequently encountered assignments requiring in-depth research of judicial rulings. The time-consuming process of manually searching for these rulings inspired me to develop a solution. This search engine streamlines legal research by providing rapid access to relevant judicial data, significantly reducing research time from hours to seconds.
* **Technical:** The project involved developing a custom web crawler in Elixir to extract legal data from the Ministry of Justice's official website. The extracted data was then stored in a PostgreSQL database. The search engine's backend, built with the Phoenix framework (Elixir), utilizes trigrams and PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities to efficiently handle Arabic text searches, yielding optimal results. The application was containerized using Docker and deployed on Fly.io, leveraging its ease of use and scalability.

### Dockyard Academy Volunteering:

* **Summary:** My time at Dockyard Academy was incredibly rewarding. I had the privilege of working with highly motivated students in their Elixir programming bootcamp. We delved into the intricacies of Elixir, exploring functional programming concepts, the OTP (Open Telecom Platform), and web development with the Phoenix framework. It was a joy to witness their enthusiasm and growth.
* **Technical:** The curriculum focused on the Elixir programming language, encompassing its core principles and practical applications. We also covered the OTP, a set of libraries and tools for building robust and scalable applications, and the Phoenix framework, which facilitates efficient web development. Witnessing students grasp these powerful technologies was truly inspiring.
* **Impact:** I'm particularly proud of the projects students undertook. One group of graduates developed a subscription tracking application, demonstrating their mastery of the OTP. Additionally, Andrew, now the host of the Citizen Coder podcast, went on to fork the Godot game engine and create Revot. It's incredibly fulfilling to know that I played a small role in their journeys.

## [Daarb Podcast](http://podcast.daarb.dev)

* **Summary:** I discuss programming and tech to grow Saudi IT talent. The podcast is in Arabic and covers a range of topics from AI to web development.

## Education

* **King Saud University:** Studying Law (Graduating 2025).
