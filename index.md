# I build simple software that amazes your customers

I'm Abdullah Alhusaini, I've been developing software for a few years, some of the languages I've used in the past include JavaScript, Python, Go, and Elixir.

## Good software is simple

Good software has a simple UI - like this website - I like to keep things simple, no one wants to navigate through a website/app with millions of menus.

Simplicity is the secret to good design.

## What I'm working on

Right now, I'm working on a few projects, Something might catch your eye.

### [Daarb Podcast](https://podcast.daarb.dev/){:target="\_blank"} - Growing Saudi IT Talents

A podcast where I discuss programming topics in Arabic to build Saudi IT talents. Topics covered include: [how AI works](https://podcast.daarb.dev/2007857/12266155-), [deploying your app to AWS](https://podcast.daarb.dev/2007857/10926037-aws), and [solving the knapsack problem with Machine learning](https://podcast.daarb.dev/2007857/11365298-).

### [DevAgent.io](https://devagent.io/){:target="\_blank"} - an AI that learns instantly.

DevAgent is a tool I helped build during the [lablab.me hackathon, the biggest AI contest in the MENA region](https://lablab.me/event/innovating-ai-solutions/refine-ai/devagent). It uses a series of proprietary technologies to learn any topic without requiring an expensive and long training process.

With this tool, your company will get answers based on your data quickly, promptly, and without mistakes.

[The official demo](https://devagent.io/) knows the Python programming language. But we can easily setup an instance that knows all about your business instead. [Contact me for more details!](/contact)

### Dungeon Breakout

Dungeon Breakout is a game that uses AI to build an underground labyrinth with many encounters and scenarios. The goal is to escape the dungeon with as much treasure as possible.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, this project is in pre-alpha. You can't download the game just yet. I'm working on an alpha version as fast as possible.

### I want to see more cool projects!

I'd love to share more projects. But attention spans are short in our day and age. [You can check out my GitHub to see more interesting tidbits](https://github.com/a-alhusaini/).
